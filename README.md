XML Schema definitions and examples for the BeerXML Standard

Future of BeerXML
================

Though I am not the original author of the BeerXML standard, the authoritative source (beerxml.com) is no longer active and appears to be abandoned.  In an effort to resurect the project, I have created this git repository.

Anyone interested in contributing to the standard, you may fork and submit pull requests or email me for direct commit access.  I am especially interested in anyone that has experience in XML schema definitions.
